Nagios check script for checking replication issues on solr slaves.

We simply get the index version that the core reports it has, and
then query the maximum possible index version the master has told the core about.

OPTIONS:

-H : hostname/ip of the solr server we want to query
-p : tcp port solr is listening on
-w : webapp path

EXAMPLE: ./check_solr_rep.py -H localhost -p 8093 -w webapp -r -P
