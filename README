Nagios check script for checking the ping status of solr cores and the replication status if a solr slave 

We simply get the index version that the core reports it has, and
then query the maximum possible index version the master has told the core about.


This plugin is in it's early stages, so improvements are welcome, it assumes you're 
running a multicore setup, and will iterate through all of them getting the ping status
if you use -P and/or the replication status if you're checking a slave and pass -r on
the command line.

There's probably better ways to decide whether an error is a WARN or CRIT, those changes will come in time...

*****************

OPTIONS:

-H : hostname/ip of the solr server we want to query
